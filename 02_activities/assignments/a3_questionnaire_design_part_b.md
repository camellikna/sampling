# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
## 1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    
    I believe , the sample cover target population :
    My target population includes both current and recently departed employees, ensuring  gather insights from those still within the company and those who have 
    left, providing a well-rounded perspective on the causes of turnover.
    Using company records from the past 12 months is a logical and relevant choice for this analysis, as it captures employees who have experienced recent 
    organizational conditions.
    

## 2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

	More response option (Clarity) :
    
	Question no 4- Do you feel you have opportunities for growth and advancement within the company? Yes Somewhat No

	(for this question I beleive It can be better if I add some parameter for choose , like this : Very satisfied Somewhat satisfied Neutral Somewhat 		dissatisfied Very dissatisfied

	Ethical considerations : Adding a consent statement to ensure anonymity and voluntary participation
    

## 3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?
    
	Observational studies alone cannot capture subjective or personal reasons for employee turnover, such as dissatisfaction with salary, career growth, or 	work-life balance. Surveys are necessary to gather direct feedback and deeper insights from employees.

	The choice depends on the type of information required. If the goal is to understand subjective motivations and individual experiences, a survey is 		essential. However, for identifying general trends and patterns, an observational study might suffice.



 Addition : 

 Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Question Design:
â€¢	Clarity and Precision:
o	Q4: "Do you feel you have opportunities for growth and advancement within the company?"
Consider adding a time frame (e.g., "Do you feel you have opportunities for growth and advancement within the company over the next year?") to make responses more actionable.
o	Q7: "What would most improve your satisfaction in your role?"
Including an "Other (please specify)" option allows respondents to share unique insights.
â€¢	Avoid Overlap:
o	Q9 and Q6 both touch on satisfaction with compensation but use slightly different wording. This may confuse respondents or lead to redundant data. Consolidate or clarify their differences.
â€¢	Consistency in Scales:
o	Q4 and Q5 use different scales (e.g., Yes/No/Somewhat vs. Very supported to Very unsupported). Standardizing response scales across the survey improves comparability.
â€¢	Ambiguity:
o	Q10: "How satisfied are you with the opportunities for growth and learning in your role?"
Correct "learn" to "learning" for better readability.

Bias of Sampling: The sampling frame includes only employees from company records over the past 12 months. This could exclude:
â€¢	Employees who left before the past 12 months, who might have valuable insights.
â€¢	Recently hired employees who may not yet have experienced factors leading to turnover.
Impact: This may overrepresent the perspectives of current employees or those who left very recently, neglecting longer-term patterns or insights.
Addressing the clarity, consistency, and structure of survey questions and refining the sampling strategy, can significantly reduce bias and gather more reliable data. This will ultimately help identify actionable insights to address turnover and improve employee satisfaction.
